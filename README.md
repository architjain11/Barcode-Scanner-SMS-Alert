# Barcode Scanner SMS Alert

App is built using MIT App Invector 2. This repository contains .aia file which is a format used by MIT App Inventor (.aia stands for App Inventor Archive).

## Idea

Each school student has a QR code on his/her ID Card. While boarding or de-boarding the bus, the student scans the code on this app installed on the bus attendant's device. The app automatically sends SMS to the student's parents along with their location. The idea is to keep the parent's updated on when their child boards or de-boards their bus and at which location. This ensures the safety of their child along with assuring that the bus reached the school on time.
